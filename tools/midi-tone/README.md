# midi-tone (Phase 0 diagnostic → tiny DIY soft-synth)

Hear and see MIDI from the **Akai MPK mini** on the Pi **without** USB-DIN or a hardware synth.

- Opens a MIDI input (prefers a port name containing `MPK`)
- Note-on → wavetable tone through the Pi audio jack / HDMI
- Tk UI: last event, active notes, scrolling event log, touch voice picker
- Bundled [Adventure Kid (AKWF)](https://github.com/KristofferKarlAxelEkstrand/AKWF-FREE) single-cycles (**CC0**) plus built-in sine/square/saw/triangle

## On the Pi (via SSH is fine)

```bash
cd ~/midi-tone
# after scp from PC:
sed -i 's/\r$//' *.sh
chmod +x setup-venv.sh run.sh install-desktop-shortcut.sh
./setup-venv.sh
```

Run (window appears on the Pi screen):

```bash
export DISPLAY=:0
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)
./run.sh --input MPK
```

Useful flags:

```bash
./run.sh --input MPK --voices 12          # polyphony (default 12)
./run.sh --waves-dir ./wavetables         # extra single-cycle WAVs
./run.sh --list                           # MIDI ports + loaded voices
```

Plug headphones or speakers into the Pi. Play the MPK — you should hear tones and see Note On/Off / CC lines.

### MPK mini knobs (morph + tone)

Factory **Prog Select → Pad 1** (MPC program) maps knobs to CC70–77:

| Knob | CC | Control |
|------|----|---------|
| 1 | 70 | **Morph** — blend through the whole wavetable stack |
| 2 | 71 | Tone / brightness (low-pass) |
| 3 | 72 | Attack |
| 4 | 73 | Release |
| 5 | 74 | Vibrato depth |
| 6 | 75 | Vibrato rate |
| 8 | 77 | Level |

Joystick Y still sends **CC1** = vibrato amount. PREV/NEXT jumps morph to a voice; Knob 1 sweeps continuously between them.

If a knob does nothing, check the event log for its CC number — your MPK program may differ.

### Voices / wavetables

Use **PREV / NEXT** on the touch bar (or tap the voice name). Drop any mono single-cycle `.wav` into `wavetables/` and restart — the stem becomes the voice name.

Fetch more AKWF cycles (needs network):

```bash
./venv/bin/python fetch_akwf.py --list
./venv/bin/python fetch_akwf.py --all
```

### Desktop icon

```bash
cd ~/midi-tone
sed -i 's/\r$//' install-desktop-shortcut.sh   # if copied from Windows
chmod +x install-desktop-shortcut.sh
./install-desktop-shortcut.sh
```

Then double-click **MIDI Tone** on the desktop. If needed: right-click → **Allow Launching**.

**SSH note:** Tk needs a display. Prefer a terminal *on the Pi desktop*. Over SSH use `ssh -X ray@192.168.1.225` (X11 forwarding) if your PC has an X server.

## On Windows (optional host test)

```powershell
cd tools\midi-tone
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python midi_tone.py --list
python midi_tone.py --input MPK
```

## Panic

UI button **All Notes Off**, or MIDI CC 123.

## Touch tips (Pi panel)

- Buttons fire on **press** (resistive panels often miss a full click).
- Log fullscreen is an explicit **EXPAND LOG** button (double-tap was removed — bounce was hiding the controls).
- If taps feel vertically offset: `./calibrate-touch-y.sh`
